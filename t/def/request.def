# request.def - definition file for requests (aka messages between client
# and server).

# Two sample entries:

{
  # this patterns is valid for all requests that match this pattern. The order
  # is not important, so "type_test;cmd_status" would also work. All params
  # must match exactly - otherwise the request pattern doesn't match.
  match = "cmd_status;type_test"
  # these params must be non-empty (and also present). Default is ""
  nonempty = "start,end,description,jobtype,charset"
  # These params must be present, but can be empty unless they are listed in
  # nonempty. Default is "". Any params in 'match' and "nonempty" are 
  # automatically added to 'required' so you don't need to list them twice.
  req = "id"
  # these params are optional (and can be empty if they are not listed in
  # nonempty). Default is "style". If you don't want "style" to be optional,
  # set 'opt = ""'.
  opt = "style"
  # The type of output sent when this pattern matches. Valid is "html" or
  # "text". Default is "html".
  output = "html"
  # name of the template file to reply if this pattern matches. Optional and
  # only neccessary if type = "html". If left empty, and type is "html", the
  # vaue will be "TYPE.txt" where type is the value of the type-param of the
  # request, e.g. here it would be "test" because "cmd_status;type_test" is
  # the matching request. This if couse works only if "type" is an allowed,
  # nonempty param and fixed, e.g. mentioned in match.
  tpl = "test.txt"
  # the title string, only necc. if output = "html"
  title = "Test Status Page"
  # The type of the request. Types: "status", "info", "auth", "request", 
  # "other". Default is "status". 
  type = "status"
  # The class of the request. This is used to deny/allow requests based on
  # IPs and nets. Other then that, the class is not used. Possible are "admin",
  # "stats", "status" and "work". Default is "admin".
  class = "status"
  # setting this to 1 means this request can only be done with proper
  # authentication (e.g. username and password). Default is 1.
  auth = 1
  # if the error message is set, the pattern will throw an error upon matching
  # a request
  # throw = "Request foo not allowed"
}

{
  match = "cmd_status;type_main"
  title = "Main Status"
  auth = 0
}

# using a regular expression for matching (starts with "/")
{
  match = "type_/^(news|changes)$;cmd_help"
  title = "Help"
  auth = 0
}

# this matches "cmd_foo;type_bar;id_anyid"
{
  match = "cmd_foo;type_bar"
  req = "id"
  title = "FooBar with ID"
  auth = 0
}

# this matches "cmd_foo;type_bar" (but not one with ID!)
{
  match = "cmd_foo;type_bar"
  title = "FooBar without ID"
  auth = 0
}

# this matches "cmd_foo;type_baz" with an error
{
  match = "cmd_foo;type_baz"
  throw = "Request baz not allowed"
  title = "FooBar"
  auth = 0
}

# All requests that don't match any of the patterns above are automatically
# invalid and rejected.
