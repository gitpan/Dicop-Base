=item Net::Server 0.85

When using v0.85 of Net::Server, starting dicopd may emit a warning from
Net::Server along the lines of:

	Couldn't POSIX::setuid to \"$uid\" []

This seems to be spurious and can be ignored.

=item Net::Server 0.97

When using this version (potentially earliers, too), and running the server
under chroot, the second request will fail because Net::Server tries
to re-open STDIN and STDERR to /dev/null - which is outside the chroot.

No workaround yet known.
